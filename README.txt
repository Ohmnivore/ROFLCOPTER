I love colors and nice formatting
in console applications. Unfortunately
it seems that Windows isn't really fond
of that, so I tried what I could to
write a quick color and animation 
expirement with 'cross-platform' in
mind. Of course NCurses is and will
always be my first choice for this
kind of thing, but I needed some color,
even on Winblows.

A packaged exe can be found in the
/dist directory.
